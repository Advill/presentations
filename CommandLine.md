# Command Line Introduction

This can be done either with a local installation or remote connection over ssh.

## Start with how to get help with a command:
- man
- apropos (man -k)

## Show a little of how to operate the terminal:
- history/up/tab/ctrl-R/!!/../~
- clear/reset/less
- cd/ls/pwd/mkdir/rm/rmdir/touch/vi (with a file browser open)

## Show that day to day tasks can be done on the command line:
- bc
- date
- cal
- lynx/links/w3m
- cowsay/fortune as fun extras

## Show a few systems level utilities:
- ssh
- scp/sftp
- top

## [Cantrill rant] (https://youtu.be/S0mviKhVmBI)
Explain the inspirations for command line piping, "the UNIX philosophy", and introduce Jon Bentley's challenge.

## Iteratively build an example of the text pipeline:
1. dmesg/echo - text source
2. cut
3. sort
4. uniq
5. tr
6. wc
7. grep
8. less/more
9. head/tail

## Show that the pipeline can begin and end with a file:
This probably should include an explanation of stderr vs stdout, but hasnâ€™t yet.
- cat
- > and <

## Bentley's challenge
`cat shakespeare.txt | tr -cs A-Za-z '\n' | tr A-Z a-z | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | sed 1q`

1. Pipe works of Shakespeare
2. Convert all non-alpha characters to newlines, then squeeze each string of repeated newlines into a single newline
3. Transform upper to lowercase
4. Sort by alpha
5. Print only unique lines with a count of duplicates
6. Reverse numeric sort
7. Print only 1 line

## Demonstrate programmability of the shell:
- seq
- for/do/done
- if/then/elif/fi
- integration.sh

## Demonstrate transforming unformatted data to something more readable:
This was a last minute hack and needs refinement.

`seq 1 500 50000 | tr '\n' ' ' | xargs -n3 echo | column -t`

1. Generate 1-50000, every 500th
2. Transform newline to space
3. Echo three rows at a time
4. Have column align columns

`seq 1 500 50000 | tr '\n' ' ' | xargs -n4 echo | tr ' ' ',' | column -t -s,`

1. Generate 1-50000, every 500th
2. Transform newline to space
3. Echo four rows at a time
4. Transform space to comma
5. Have column break on comma and align columns
